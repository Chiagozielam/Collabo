          Our aim is to encourage collaboration in different sectors in the technology universe, including, graphic
          designing,
          UI/Ux designs, Technical writing, Web development, other programming fields. We assume that the person who
          posts the collabo project is skilled in an area and needs someone else to comlement his skills, or needs help
          to acheive the
          completion of a project within a strict time frame, or needs a partnership
          We beleive that helping others is one of the greatest things that can be and as such we encourage people to
          engage in Partnership
          projects as much as they would have the time to. We do not support or promote gender inequallity in any form,
          and as such, all collabo
          postings shouldn't be gender specific and anyone who meets the desired criteriers is free to apply for any
          collabo project.
          We beleive that together we can do the impossible.
